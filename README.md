## Epidemic-Analysis-and-Forecasting
we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the epidemics. Our focus was on parameter estimation, forecasting the spread of the virus, and evaluating different models' performance. Here is a summary of our findings: 
#### 1. Parameter Estimation and Forecasting the Spread of Epidemic.
* To predict the short-term forecast of confirmed cases, we applied the logistic growth model.
* The logistic model yielded a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5229.7 and 1,924.4, indicating a good fit.
* We assessed the performance of our model by evaluating its goodness of fit.

### 2. Gaussian Model and Reproduction Numbers
* We employed the Gaussian model to fit the daily number of confirmed cases, considering reproduction numbers.
* The following Figure illustrates the Gaussian model's fit to the daily number of confirmed cases, showing a good alignment with the actual data.
